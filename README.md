# Calculator App

The calculator implements touch/click input through its keypad, providing these symbols to create formulas:
`+ - รท / ( )`. The `=` key will trigger evaluation of the formula. There is also a `C` key to clear all input, and a `Del` key to delete the last inputted character. There are two display fields: one shows the user's formula; the other displays the formula's evaluation.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). A lengthy guide to that generator can be found [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
